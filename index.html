        My travels of Japan all stated in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</a>.  
        After a brutal 14 hour plane ride
        from St. Louis me and my friends arrived in Shinjuku where we would find our
        lives would never be the same.  It only seemed that a sip of Saki was all it 
        took begin our downward spiral in to degeneracy.

        After 4 long nights in Tokyo it was evident that our bodies and souls were in 
        need of rest and relaxation.  It was at this point that we took our ventures 
        to the hallowed grounds of Mt. Fuji.  Here we soaked in the ancient minerals
        and basked in the shadows of the volcano of lore.  With engery renewed and our
        spirits higher than ever we found the strength and fortitude to continue our
        trek across The Land of the Rising Sun.

    <h2>Osaka</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
        With renewed vigor, we stepped off the bullet train to the famed city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Osaka</a>.
        Little did we know what our first night would hold for us.  The excitement and
        terror were equal in magnitude.  While we got far more than we bargained for, we
        were not deterred in continued our explorations of this fabled city feasting on
        every type of delicacy we could get our hands on.

    <h2>Kyoto</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
        Kyoto was one of our final stops.  This ancient city - once the capitol of Japan -
        would prove to be our salvation.  Were it not for the fortunes of good karma 
        bestowed upon us while in Kyoto I would have little confidence in my ability to 
        retell the tales of my trip.
